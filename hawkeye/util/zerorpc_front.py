"""
Method for receiving messages from the RH Gateway and sending them back
over to the ZeroRPC Server instance at the RH Session Node.js side.
Each item placed in the outbox is (should be) an array of RH_Message.

This outbox is at this time shared across all Proxy_Base entities for
asynchronous communication.  ZeroRPC may deadlock if all attempt to 
access the queue at once from, effectively, the same greenlet.  This
is mitigated by collecting all queued messages into a single payload
delivered as often as possible.
